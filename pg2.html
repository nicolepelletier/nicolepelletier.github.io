        <p><font size=4 ><center>Lucie was born in Kansas around April 15, 2007; she came to Maine two months later. She lived to be just over ten years old. Lucie loved to run, bark, and cuddle. One characteristic which set Lucie apart from other dogs was her preference of people to dogs. Lucie was well trained; her repitoire includeded sit, down, paw, high five, play dead, roll over, and beg. She was known for her vocal personality and tendency to follow my family around the house.</center></font></p>
