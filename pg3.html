        <p><center><font size=4 >My family and I met Princesa and her mother, Fausta, at an ecolodge, Princesa de la Luna, in La Fortuna, Costa Rica. My parents and I first traveled to Costa Rica in February 2016 and first met Princesa when she was two months old. Princesa and Fausta lived in La Fortuna and were allowed to roam free throughout the property. My family traveled back again in January 2017 and found Princesa and Fausta to be just as adventurous.</font></center></p>
