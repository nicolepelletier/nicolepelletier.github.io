        <p><center>Since the passing of Lucie my family has decided to foster animals instead of getting a new pet. We got our first foster pet shortly before Christmas 2017. Coffee, a mutt from our local shelter required a home until a surgery he had to receive before being elligible for adoption. He found a foster family to stay with but they were not going to be home for the holiday season. My mom and I picked up coffee on December 23rd and brought him back to the Humane Society on December 30th. Although the time frame was short, we all learned a lot about foster care, especially when it involves rambunctious puppy. Through all the puzzle piece eating, biting, and dirty paws, we all agree that we miss seeing Coffee around the house.</center></p>
